  <strong> üìä Mev Sandwich Bot</strong>

</p>



<p align="center">


</p>



The **MEV Sandwich Bot** is a tool for **automated profit generation** on blockchains, leveraging sandwich attacks and other arbitrage strategies. It analyzes unconfirmed transactions in the mempool, generating profit by influencing token prices.



#### üéØ How It Works



-   **Front-running**: The bot places its transaction before a large user transaction.

-   **Victim‚Äôs Transaction**: The user‚Äôs main transaction goes through at an altered price.

-   **Back-running**: The bot sells tokens at the new price to capture profit.



#### üí° Key Benefits



-   **Efficient unconfirmed transaction scanning**: The bot detects profitable transactions in real-time.

-   **Liquidity filtering and scam protection**: Built-in filters avoid low-liquidity or suspicious tokens by using contract audits, e.g., through Scansniffer.





#### üöÄ Launching in DeployerIDE








### Advantages of the Local Deployer



The **DeployerIDE** local deployer provides a secure and efficient environment for creating and managing smart contracts, offering a level of control and transparency that browser-based IDEs struggle to match.



----------



#### Advantages over Browser-based IDEs:



-   **Ease of Management**: DeployerIDE‚Äôs interface is simple and intuitive, allowing users to insert source code, compile, and deploy contracts effortlessly.

    

-   **Contract History Preservation**: All created contracts are saved under `Load Contracts`, providing full access to manage them even after closing the application.

    

-   **Detailed Action Logging**: DeployerIDE logs all actions for enhanced transparency and tracking.

    

-   **Network Support**: Currently supports **Ethereum**, **BNB**, **Test BNB**, and **Sepolia** networks, allowing you to test and deploy contracts within these environments.
